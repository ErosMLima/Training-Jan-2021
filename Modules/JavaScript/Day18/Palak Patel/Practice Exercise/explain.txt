var type of variable's scope is globle while let type of variable is limited to it's scope only where it is defined.

for example:
let's take a variable named v1 of type var and defined some value to it.
 var v1 = 50;

now taking a function called demo and redifing the same variable v1 as let type

function demo(){
    let v1 = 100; //the scope of this variable is limited to this function only.
}

now if we print variable v1 outside of the function the ans will be 50 not 100.
console.log(v1); //this will print 50 as answer.
