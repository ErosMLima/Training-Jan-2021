Scenario 4-2: Comparing Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes
Your boss wants to speed things up on the companyâ€™s database server. Therefore, he is thinking of having you create a couple of indexes. He asks you to explain the advantages and disadvantages of creating a clustered index versus a non-clustered index. How should you respond
Ans. 
Clustered Index:
1. Clustered indexes sort and store the data rows in the table based on their key values.
2. There can be only one clustered index per table
3. It can be unique 

Non Clustered Index:
1. A nonclustered index contains the nonclustered index key values and each key value entry has a pointer to the data row that contains the key value.
2. The pointer from an index row in a nonclustered index to a data row is called a row locator. The structure of the row locator depends on whether the data pages are stored in a heap or a clustered table. For a heap, a row locator is a pointer to the row. For a clustered table, the row locator is the clustered index key.
3. It can be Unique.
4. A table can have multiple non-clustered index.
