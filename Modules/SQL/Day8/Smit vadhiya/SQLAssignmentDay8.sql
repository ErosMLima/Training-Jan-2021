/*
As a database administrator, you need to increase the performance of the PlanetsID table, so
you decide to create a clustered index. But instead of using SSMS, you decide to use queries
to perform this task. Therefore, you create a new PlanetsID database using the following
commands within SMMS:
IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects
WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N�[dbo] . [PlanetsID]
AND type in (N�U�))
USE AdventureWorks2008
DROP TABLE [dbo].[PlanetsID]
GO
USE [AdventureWorks2008]
GO
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[PlanetsID](
[ID] [int] NOT NULL,
[Item] [int] NOT NULL,
[Value] [int] NOT NULL
) ON [PRIMARY]
GO
INSERT INTO PlanetsID VALUES (4, 23, 66)
INSERT INTO PlanetsID VALUES (1, 12, 59)
INSERT INTO PlanetsID VALUES (3, 66, 24)
SELECT * FROM PlanetID
GO
You should now see the following output in the results pane (below the Query Editor
Window):
ID Item Value
4 23 66
1 12 59
3 66 24
Now that you have a database with data, what steps would you use to create a clustered index
based on the ID column?

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[PlanetsID](
[ID] [int] NOT NULL,
[Item] [int] NOT NULL,
[Value] [int] NOT NULL
) ON [PRIMARY]
GO
INSERT INTO PlanetsID VALUES (4, 23, 66)
INSERT INTO PlanetsID VALUES (1, 12, 59)
INSERT INTO PlanetsID VALUES (3, 66, 24)
SELECT * FROM PlanetsID
GO

--there is no index added in the table so data is shoeing without any sorting

--first we add clustered index on ID column

CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX ClusteredIndexOnID
on PlanetsID(ID)


SELECT * FROM PlanetsID--this query give output by shorting data by id becatuse Clustered index is applied to ID

CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX NonClusteredIndexOnItem
on PlanetsID(Item)
--we can create nonclustered index by this statement on item column

DROP INDEX NonClusteredIndexOnItem ON PlanetsID --WE CAN DELETE INDEX BY THIS STATEMENT WHICH DELETE INDEX BY NAME OF INDEX

CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX ClusteredIndexOnValue
on PlanetsID(Value)-- WE CAN NOT CREATE ANOTHER CLUSTERED INDEX BECAUSE WE ALREADY CREATED ONE SO THIS WILL GIVE ERROR
