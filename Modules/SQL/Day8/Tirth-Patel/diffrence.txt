Scenario 4-2: Comparing Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes

1.only one clustered index per table is allowed where as you can have more than one non clustered index.

2.Clustered index is faster than non clustered index , because the clustered index has top refer back to 
	the table , if select column is not present in the index

3. Clustered index determines the storage order of rows in table and hence doesnt require addintional 
	diskspace but where as Non clustered index is stored speratelty from table so additional 
	Storage space is required.
