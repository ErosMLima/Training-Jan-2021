                            HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.HTML was 
                            first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
                            Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to 
                            another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5. A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to 
                            each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.

                            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML 
                            or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. CSS is among 
                            the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers.CSS also has rules for alternate formatting 
                            if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

                            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
                            While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as 
                            Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic 
                            language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

                        Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which,through casual or organized participation, 
                        at least in part aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and

                        Sports can bring positive results to one's physical health. Hundreds of sports 
                        exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams 
                        or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively,
                        with one  winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other.

                        Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner;others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one 
                        winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an
                        annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.
