1.Write difference between fetch and pull
git fetch is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data info from the original (yet doesn’t do any file transferring. It’s more like just checking to see if there are any changes available).

git pull on the other hand does that AND brings (copy) those changes from the remote repository.

You can use git fetch to know the changes done in the remote repo/branch since your last pull. This is useful to allow for checking before doing an actual pull, which could change files in your current branch and working copy (and potentially lose your changes, etc).

2.Write difference between and stage the changes and stash the changes
 Stash will move your modified files into a stack. So, later in the same or in another branch, you will be able to bring them back and see those modifications in your project.
Stage is the step before to make a commit, you add modified files to "Staged files" to create your next commit.
