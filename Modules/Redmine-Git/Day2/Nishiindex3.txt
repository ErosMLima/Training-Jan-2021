[1]difference betweem fetch and pull:

git fetch is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data info from the original.it doesnot do any file transfering.it is more like just checking to see iit there
are any changes available.

git pull on the other hand doesthat AND brings those changes from the remote repository.

[2]difference between stash and stage

stash will move your modified files into a stack.so later in same or another branch,you will be able to bring them back and see those modifications in your project.

stage is the step before to make a commit,you add modified files to"staged files" to create your next commit.
